# BA-Project-Predicting-cardiovascular-disease-FInal
## Autors: Sofia Vargas, Said Berrezueta, Joseph Galarza
This proyect is created by students with information was provided by public and private health institutions. The main aim of this project is to develop a model capable of predicting the probability of an individual developing a cardiovascular disease. This prediction will be based on an analysis of their personal characteristics and daily habits (18 variables). Due to the large amount of data, preprocessing must be performed, taking into account the nature of the variables and their outliers, as well as balancing the data to ensure a well-represented sample. Once the preprocessing is complete, models are trained using different algorithms to compare them and select the most optimal one.
